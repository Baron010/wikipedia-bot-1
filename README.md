## Introduction

### What is this bot all about?

*TL;DR - it's just a amazing bot!*

The Wikipedia Bot sends you short summaries of a Wikipedia article you searched for. 

You can quickly share the information about a topic on your Discord server, for example you want information about a game or a person.

In future updates, it will also read articles for you with text-to-speech support and it will be able to send you a list of the references used in a Wikipedia article.

### [Commands](https://github.com/julianYaman/wikipedia-bot/blob/master/COMMANDS.md)

## Contribution

Any type of contribution is welcome. Even reporting problems or giving feedback via the Issues section
does help a lot to know how to improve the bot and to fix problems with the bot.

Before developing, create a special branch for your features or fixes you want to made 
(if you want to make a pull request to this repository).

- *Fork the repository.*
- *Optional: Check the ToDOs in the code!*
- ``git checkout -b branch-name `` *(e.g. issue-fix-#1 or so)*
- ``git commit -am 'Added something / Fixed something'``
- ``git push origin branch-name``
- Make a **[pull request](https://github.com/julianYaman/wikipedia-bot/pull/new/master)**. Someone will then review your code.

## Installation guide

Before doing any development and testing of the bot, you should install all packages 
which are required with

```npm install```

Also check that you update **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)** and optionally install the packages again to update them.
But in this case, [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) takes care of updating the *package.json* dependencies.
